<h1 align="center">Android iOS AutoFarm Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project automates interactions across Android and iOS devices—perfect for managing large-scale phone farms used in app engagement, affiliate farming, or social signal generation. The main goal? Build a lightweight, script-driven automation framework that can scale across multiple real devices or emulators with minimal manual input.

The original request came from a forum discussion where a developer was looking for a collaborator to help build "simple automation software" for Android/iOS. While the project sounds straightforward, it taps into a powerful niche: mobile automation for growth hacking, engagement farming, and stealth operations. Think tap, swipe, scroll, click—but smarter.


## Core Features:
- **Cross-Platform Flexibility** – Works on both Android and iOS devices using frameworks like Appium or Appilot.
- **Plug & Play Scaling** – Easily deploy to multiple devices or emulators with minimal setup, perfect for phone farms.
- **Human-like Execution** – Tap, swipe, and scroll actions mimic real user behavior with randomized intervals and patterns
